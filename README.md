DSL Rep Tracker

## Problem Background
One well-known auto parts firm, Douglas and Sons, depends on its sales agents to deliver merchandise to clients in different parts of the country. The company has no system in place to monitor the real-time location of these sales reps during their deliveries. Significant difficulties arise from this lack of visibility, such as the inability to monitor the effectiveness and responsibility of the sales team, the possibility of supply delays, and the inability to get up-to-date information on the locations of the sales representatives. Because of this, the business finds it difficult to efficiently oversee its delivery operations and guarantee that clients receive their goods on schedule.

## Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, Douglas and Sons proposes the development of an Android-based GPS tracking app named LocationTracker. This app is designed to monitor the real-time location of sales representatives, with updates every 15 minutes. The app will include features such as real-time location updates, historical data storage, and secure user authentication. Additionally, LocationTracker will have a built-in notification system that alerts the admin if a sales rep turns off location tracking or if there is any interruption in data reporting. This ensures that any potential issues are promptly addressed, enhancing operational efficiency and accountability. By implementing LocationTracker Douglas and Sons will improve visibility into delivery operations, optimise route planning, and ensure timely deliveries, ultimately leading to increased operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
